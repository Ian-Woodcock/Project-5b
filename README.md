### 3 things I liked with scala
- relativley simple syntax
- I liked how things are formatted in scala
- I like that it uses a main method. it makes it easier to order how you want things run without having to have written the code in a certain order

### 3 things I didnt like as much
- while i said I like the syntax, there were a few things that I didnt like such as using <- in for loops, but thats just a thing that I would be fine with after getting used
  to the language a bit more
- i dont like that there is anything at the end of a line in scala, but thats just me nitpicking based on what im more used like my previous complaint. I kept placing
  semi-colons by habit
- dont have a 3rd complaint honestly, really enjoyed this language, so I guess ill type i got Sick while working on this project and that kinda sucks, didnt like that
